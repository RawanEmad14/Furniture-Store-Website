1 - Home Page :
	=> HTML :
		+ code is very well structured
		+ semantic tags are used properly 
		+ code is well commented
		- commented code should be removed before pushing the code to github (lines : 65-72)
	=> CSS :
		+ using variables in code 
		+ code is well commented
		+ using flex - grid to move elements 
		+ applying reasonable margin - padding to elements
		+ proper use of the transform property ++ 
		+ giving classes meaningful and descriptive names
		+ good responsive view
		- (in the reviews section) giving a fixed width of 500px to the grid elements is not preferable , better to give it a width of 1fr
		- (in the reviews section) mobile view is not handled properly in this section 
		- commented code should be removed before pushing the code to github

3 - Services Page :
	=> HTML :

		+ code is well commented
		+ giving classes meaningful and descriptive names
		+ applying reasonable margin - padding to elements
		+ using (flex - grid) to move elements

	=> JS :
		+ writing good code for handling muiltiple views with javascript ++
		- functions are redundant and can be reduced to a single function with multiple parameters to handle each case (but overall ok)

4 - About-Us Page :
	=> HTML :
		+ code is very well structured
		+ code is well commented
		- don't use a single container to hold all sections
		- (in our-team section content) <aside> is not the most proper semantic tag to be used in this part, revise other semantic tags used in this page
		- multiple footers are not SEO Friendly , consider reading about the proper use of each semantic tag as they should be meaningful to the content they hold 
	=> CSS :
		+ using variables in code 
		+ code is well commented
		+ using (flex) to move elements 
		+ applying reasonable margin - padding to elements
		+ giving classes meaningful and descriptive names
		+ separating responsive design code from the original code is a very good practice ++
		- (in about-us.our-team.talk) button size is better controlled by padding "only" instead of using width,height

5 - Login & SignUp Pages :
	=> HTML :
		+ code is very well structured
		
	=> CSS :
		+ using variables in code 
		+ code is well commented
		+ using (flex) to move elements inside login div 
		+ applying reasonable margin - padding to elements
		+ giving classes meaningful and descriptive names
		+ using validation on input fields
		- float is not used properly as the login div should 've been given a float left and the clearfix div should 've been used after (refer to the session or ask any of the mentors)
	=> (for the responsive view in both pages)
		- giving the body a background image and 100vh is not reasonable, instead use a div and apply these properties to it
